# NER using Snorkel and Transfer learning

- In this project, we intend to show that Transfer learning via bootstrapping can be used to label data along with the help of a weak tagger like Snorkel

### How to run
 - All of the code is written in python notebooks.
 - The code runs smoothly in **kaggle** hence it is advised to run it there itself.
 - Use appropriate paths for datafiles

 ### Libraries and dependencies
 - Tensorflow v1 used to incorporate Elmo
 - Keras used for neural model implementation
 - Other libraries include:
    - json, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn etc...
