 the european commission said on thursday it disagreed with german advice to consumers to shun british lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep . 
 germany 's representative to the european union 's veterinary committee werner zwingmann said on wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than britain until the scientific advice was clearer . 
 " we do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it , " the commission 's chief spokesman nikolaus van der pas told a news briefing . 
 he said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the european union . 
 he said a proposal last month by eu farm commissioner franz fischler to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health . 
 fischler proposed eu-wide measures after reports from britain and france that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) -- mad cow disease . 
 but fischler agreed to review his proposal after the eu 's standing veterinary committee , mational animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health . 
 spanish farm minister loyola de palacio had earlier accused fischler at an eu farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through " dangerous generalisation . "
